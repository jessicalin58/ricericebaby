## What is this?

Ricetrology is an app that analyzes photos of rice that you upload and tells you your fortune.

## Why are you doing this?

We want to help people make better decisions while eating fewer carbs.

## What do I do?

1) Take a photo of some rice
2) Upload said photo
3) Allow the light from the text that appears to enter your retina
4) Process it using your visual cortex
5) Let your brain do its thing

## Help! All the answers are wrong!

Have you tried turning it off and on again?
